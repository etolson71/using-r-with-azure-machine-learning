# Use R interactively on an Azure Machine Learning Compute Instance with Visual Studio Code

In step 01, you installed some additional R packages (`languageserver` and `httpgd`) to be able to use Visual Studio Code with R.

1. Open the `03-develop-in-interactive-r/interactive-r-script.r` file in Visual Studio Code
1. You will be prompted to trust the file and wether you also want to trust the entire folder. Click _Yes_
1. You will also be prompted to install the _R Extension for VSCode_. Click Install

Once you do all of this, you can work with the R script interactively. Similar to other IDEs, you can select a block of code and submit it to run. 

- On macos, send a block of code to the running R session by selecting the code and using `Command` + `Enter`
